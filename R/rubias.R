#' rubias: A package for bias correction in hierarchical GSI
#'
#' In order to document and counteract the bias presented by uneven hierarchical structure
#' in genetic stock identification (GSI), this function takes input reference and mixture
#' genetic data, and returns GSI results with and without bias correction options. Tests are
#' also included to assess the necessity and validity of correction for a given dataset.
#'
#' GSI is often confronted with a hierarchical population structure (i.e. genetic reference
#' sets collected at one level, but with sample proportion estimates needed for a higher
#' level made up of groups of collections). Conventional GSI obtains higher-level mixture
#' proportions by summing the lower-level proportions; however, this may lead to bias when
#' reporting units contain different numbers of populations, and misassignment inordinately
#' favors those reporting units with higher numbers of collections.
#'
#'
#' @section the \code{rubias} functions:
#'
#' The following functions are wrappers, designed for user-friendly input and useful output:
#'
#' \code{ref_and_mix_pipeline} is used to perform a single case of genetic stock identification.
#' It takes independent and mixture datasets (with identical structure) and a choice of
#' method, and returns GSI estimates of the mixture proportions and posterior probabilities
#' of assignment for the mixture dataset. Options include standard MCMC, bootstrap bias
#' correction, and hierarchical assignment-scaled MCMC.
#'
#' \code{Hasselman_simulation_pipeline} submits a provided reference dataset to the validation
#' methods used in Hasselman et al. (2015). Populations are simulated from the reference using
#' Dirichlet-random mixture proportions, and it returns diagnostic plots and information
#' after running standard MCMC, parametric bootstrapping, and hierarchical MCMC.
#'
#' \code{bias_comparison} runs \code{mixture_draw} with fifty Dirichlet random mixture
#' proportions, and returns diagnostic plots and information after running standard MCMC,
#' parametric bootstrapping, and hierarchical MCMC.
#'
#' The following functions are internal:
#'
#' \code{tcf2param_list} takes two-column format genetic data
#' (see \code{alewife} example datset) and returns the information necessary for other
#' functions in the package.
#'
#' \code{gprob_sim_gc}, \code{gprob_sim_ind}, and \code{gprob_sim_ind}, simulate genotype
#' log-likelihoods from a reference param_list by gene copy, individual, and by gene copy
#' with missing data patterns from individuals, respectively.
#'
#' \code{geno_logL} calculates the genotype log-likelihoods of a given dataset; for use in
#' MCMC, this output must be converted to scaled likelihoods by exponentiating and normalizing
#' to sum to 1.
#'
#' \code{gsi_mcmc_1}, \code{gsi_mcmc_2}, and \code{bootstrap_rho} are the underlying genetic
#' stock identification functions for standard MCMC, hierarchical assignment-scaled MCMC,
#' and a parametric bootstrapping-corrected mixture estimate, respectively. Ease of use is
#' best achieved through \code{ref_and_mix_pipeline}, but see the documentation of the
#' individual functions for information on altering trace sampling rates, burn-in, etc.
#'
#' \code{avg_coll2correctRU} takes a scaled likihood matrix, along with population structure
#' information contained in \code{tcf2param_list} output, and returns a matrix of the average
#' rates of assignment from each population to its reporting unit; used in the "BH"
#' heuristic bias correction method.
#'
#' \code{mixture_draw} splits a dataset into a mixture and reference dataset,
#' with the mixture having specified size and reporting unit or collection proportions,
#' for use in cross-validation. \emph{Note}: in the current implmentation,
#' both sample size and proportions of the mixture set may not exactly match input,
#' due to rounding.
#'
#'
#' @section genetic data format:
#' If not provided as factors, the "collection" and "repunit" will be converted to factors,
#' ordered by their order of appearance, for all functions in the package.
#'
#' @section example data:
#' \code{alewife} & \code{blueback} are examples of good times to use \code{rubias};
#' there are clearly observable biases based on the number of collections in a
#' reporting unit. \code{chinook} is an example of a dataset in which examination of
#' the graphs from \code{bias_comparison} reveal that rubias is not appropriate;
#' there was no appreciable bias to begin with, and so both the misassignment-scaling
#' and parametric boostrap methods have no consistent effect on the mean residual,
#' and often increase mean squared error
